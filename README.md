# ReddamBattingSystem
## 1. Problem summary
### What is the problem?
In my school, teachers’ valuable and limited time is used to manually sort out batting for absent teachers. This is tedious, consequently I wish to alleviate the stress on the teachers by writing a program that can sort out the batting in a margin of the time. Therefore giving some time back to the teachers.
### Brief program Functionality
The program has two main sections: 1) Teacher Manager, 2) Batting Manager, 3) Statistics
* Teacher Manager is concerned with the teachers, adding to, deleting from and updating teachers in the database. 
* Batting Manager is concerned with finding replacement teachers for lessons that an absent teacher would have. Selecting what teacher(s) was/were absent should result in a Batting Schedule being outputted. There will also be an option to manually create a batting list if the admin wishes to. This should be sent - via email - to the teachers who are batting and the register teachers of the classes who have batting.
* Statistics is mainly a viewing platform for the administrator of the batting schedules. This enables them to view which teacher has the most free lessons per week, which teacher has done the most batting, has the most extra mural activities, has been absent the most, etc.
### Target users
This program is meant for Reddam House Ballito exclusively. In the future, it can be expanded to be diversified for any school. Specifically, the program aims to better the experience of the teacher in charge of the batting program.

## Inspiration
‘Lord of the Geeks’, Clifton Lloyd Bartholomew was hugely my motivation and the idea was his. My mother is a teacher at my school and as such I am aware of how tired educators can get from doing their job. Consequently, I would like to make the teachers’ lives a bit easier by balancing the batting load of teachers without placing the pressure on anyone to make the decisions themselves. 

In essence, I want to ensure that my educators are not unevenly overstressed, but that everyone has the same load to bear.
